# 🚀 LLMReady

**Helping developers, product managers, and designers to build the future of LLM-first products.**

LLMReady is a resource hub that bridges the gap between traditional application design and the world of AI-first experiences. We provide practical guidance, frameworks, and tools to help you make your products more accessible, understandable, and usable by large language models (LLMs).

## 🔍 Why LLMReady?
As LLMs become increasingly integrated into how users discover and interact with digital products, optimizing for AI comprehension is becoming as important as optimizing for human users. LLMReady helps you stay ahead of this paradigm shift with actionable insights and proven strategies.
